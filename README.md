## Description 

Logic module for Gira Homeserver to record and compare counter values.
The module records values of a specific counter. If the input counter has an overflow, the module outputs a continious value.

The module provides counter values for up to three intervals.
For each interval, the increase of the counter during the current interval and the increase during the passed intverval, is given.

All calculations are performed on `Counter = (Counter * Gain) - Offset`.

## Inputs

| No. | Name | Initialisation | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Counter | 0 | Current counter value |
| 2 | Reset 1 | 0 | Resets counter of interval 1 when receiving 1. Setting the current interval counter as new previous. |
| 3 | Reset 2 | 0 | Resets counter of interval 1 when receiving 1. Setting the current interval counter as new previous. |
| 4 | Reset 3 | 0 | Resets counter of interval 1 when receiving 1. Setting the current interval counter as new previous. |
| 5 | Gain | 0 | All calculations are performed on `Counter = (Counter * Gain) - Offset`  |
| 6 | Reset | 0 | Resets all counters and retentive data. |
| 7 | Offset | 0 | All calculations are performed on `Counter = (Counter * Gain) - Offset` |

## Outputs

| No. | Name | Initialisation | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Counter total | 0 | |
| 2 | Current 1 | 0 | |
| 3 | Previous 1 | 0 | |
| 4 | Current 2 | 0 | |
| 5 | Previous 2 | 0 | |
| 6 | Current 3 | 0 | |
| 7 | Previous 3 | 0 | |

## Sample Values

| Input | Output |
| --- | --- |
| On init | All outputs set to the previosuly stored retentive values |
| Counter = A | Output `Current x` set to `A - Previous x` with x = 1/2/3 |
| Counter = B | Output `Current x` set to `B - Previous x` with x = 1/2/3 |
| Reset 1 = 1 | Output `Previous 1 = Current 1` and afterwards `Current 1 = 0` |

## Requirements
- The module shall output the consumptions since the beginning for all current time spans.
- The module shall output the total consumptions of the previous time spans.
- The module shall use an increasing counter as input for calculating the consumptions.
- The module should use a pulse signal input for calculating the consumptions.
- The start / end of a time span shall be indicated by a 1 on a dedicated input.
- The module shall accept a gain input to be multiplied with the counter input value.
- The module shall accept an offset input value to be substracted from the gained counter input value.
- The module shall accept a "reset" input, setting all outputs and internal values to 0.
- The module shall output the global counter repsecting gain and offset since the last reset.
- The module shall deal with an overflow of the input counter by 

## Software Design Description

### Definitions

| Abbrev. | Description |
| --- | --- | 
| `ts` | Time span |
| `sts` | Start of time span |
| `ic` | Input counter value |
| `ic_curr` | Current input counter value received, respecting gain and offset. |
| `ic_prev` | Last input counter value received, respecting gain and offset. |
| `ts1_lc` | Local counter containing the consumption of the current time span 1. |
| `gc` | Global counter containing the counter value (incl. gain & offset) since the last reset. |
| `ts1_gc_sts` | Global value of counter at the beginning of the *current* time span 1 *and* at the end of the *previous* time span 1. |
| `ts1_cons_curr` | Consumption of the current time span 1, increasing with new ic. |
| `ts1_cons_pev` | Total consuption during the previous time span 1. |

### Solution Outline

Calculations are based on an global counter. This counte is first initialised by the first in value recived. The global counter is increased by the delta of two ic values recieved. To caluclate the consuption during a time span, the value of the global counter at the beginning of the time span is stored. This vlaue equals the value of the gloabl counter at the end of the previous time span. Consumptions are caluclated by substracting the global counter values stored.

### Calculations
| Description | Formula |
| --- | --- |
| Input counter respecting input counter (ic) gain (k) and offset (o) | `ic_curr = k * ic - o` |
| Receive new ic_curr value and deal with ic buffer overrun | `ic_prev > ic_curr ? gc += ic_curr : gc += ic_curr - ic_prev` <br> `ic_prev = ic_curr` |
| Local counter during for the on-going time span 1 | `ts1_lc = gc - ts1_gc_sts` |
| Receive end / start interval trigger | `ts1_cons_prev = gc - ts1_gc_sts`< br> `ts1_gc_sts = gc` <br> `ts1_cons_curr = 0`|

### Retentive storage

- `gc`
- `ts1_gc_sts`
- `ic_prev`
